# JsonPath

`JsonPath` is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that allows the user to use the JsonPath syntax to filter and view their json documents in the editor.

However, since there is no official spec for JsonPath, we will be using [JSONPath Plus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus).

## Features

As this is currently a WIP I will list the target features:

- Live editing/viewing.
  - I see extensions that support command parameters for this functionality and to me this seems obtuse, so I will attempt to make it live.

## Requirements

WIP.

## Extension Settings

WIP.
