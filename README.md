# JsonPath

`JsonPath` is an extension for [Visual Studio Code]() that allows the user to use the [JsonPath]() syntax to filter and view their json documents in the editor.

## Features

As this is currently a WIP I will list the target features:

- Live editing/viewing.
  - I see extensions that support command parameters for this functionality and to me this seems obtuse, so I will attempt to make it live.

## Requirements

WIP.

## Extension Settings
